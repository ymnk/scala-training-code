h2. Scala training - code

This github project is the code used for the Scala training course. It is recommended to solve them supervised during a training session.

The slides which go along with the code is kept at "Scala training slides":http://github.com/javaBin/scala-training-slides. You should check out the readme in the slide project to understand a little bit more of the background for the training class and how we performed it.

h3. Topics

The code has been divided into the following topics
* Intro - a little warm up
* First class functions - various exercises covering use of first class functions
* Pattern matching - various types of pattern matching
* oo-traits - exploring some of the topics around object orientation and trait support. Also a few exercises exploring syntax.
* tmoriss-list - exercises from "http://blog.tmorris.net/revised-scala-exercises/":http://blog.tmorris.net/revised-scala-exercises/
* tmoriss-option - exercises from "http://blog.tmorris.net/even-further-understanding-scalaoption-part-2/":http://blog.tmorris.net/even-further-understanding-scalaoption-part-2/


We believe these tasks are enough for day one of the course. Second day would typically be only the quiz project, which is a larger task. To solve it you must parse some XML, write a console app and a Scala Swing app.

h3. Solutions

All the tasks have been solved in a Git branch called 'solutions'. You may also download this code directly from Github with the following link:
